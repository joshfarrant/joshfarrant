# Hello, I'm Josh 

I'm a Senior Software Engineer at :octocat:

I enjoy crafting adaptable, composable, and accessible design systems. I love chatting and learning about web performance, accessibility, effective mentoring, open-source, and [The IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/).

If you want to chat, get in touch! ðŸ’–
