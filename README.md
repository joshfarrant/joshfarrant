# Hello, I'm Josh 🧞‍♂️

I'm a senior front end developer at Purplebricks with a passion for open-source and making the web blazing fast and accessible for everyone. ✨

I love chatting and learning about web performance, accessibility, how to be a effective mentor, and open-source in general. If you want to chat, get in touch! 💖
